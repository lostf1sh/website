# welcome to my blog

decided to start writing down my thoughts and experiences. mostly tech stuff, but also random things i find interesting.

## why blog?

- document my learning journey
- share solutions to problems i've faced
- practice writing and articulating ideas
- connect with other devs

## what to expect

posts about web dev, projects i'm working on, tools i discover, and occasional random thoughts. no fixed schedule - i'll write when i have something worth sharing.

thanks for reading.
