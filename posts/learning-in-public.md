# learning in public

been thinking about this concept lately. sharing what you learn as you learn it.

## why it works

**for yourself:**
- forces you to understand things deeply
- creates a record of your progress
- builds confidence in your knowledge

**for others:**
- helps beginners who are one step behind you
- creates connections with people learning similar things
- contributes to the community

## overcoming fear

biggest obstacle is thinking "who am I to teach this?" but here's the thing - you don't need to be an expert. you just need to be one step ahead.

your perspective as a learner is actually valuable because you remember what it's like to not understand.

## how to start

- write about problems you solved today
- share code snippets that helped you
- document your thought process
- don't worry about perfection

## my commitment

this blog is part of my learning in public journey. not everything will be profound. some posts might be wrong. but it's all part of the process.
