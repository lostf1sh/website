# my dev setup

people often ask about my setup, so here's a quick rundown.

## editor

switched between vscode and zed lately. both are great. zed is incredibly fast but vscode has better extension support.

**current vscode extensions:**
- catppuccin theme (obviously)
- prettier
- eslint
- vue language features

## terminal

using wezterm with catppuccin mocha theme. fast, configurable, and looks great.

## workflow

- git for version control
- bun/npm for package management
- vite for building (blazingly fast)
- netlify for deployment

## music

always coding with music. lofi, post-rock, or whatever fits the mood. check my spotify on the homepage to see what i'm listening to.

## final thoughts

tools matter less than you think. find what works for you and master it. don't get caught in the endless customization loop (though it's fun).
