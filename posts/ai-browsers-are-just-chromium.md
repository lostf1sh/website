# ai browsers are just chromium

another day, another "revolutionary ai browser" launches. it's just chromium with a sidebar. again.

## the pattern

1. take chromium
2. add ai chatbot in sidebar
3. maybe throw in some "smart" features
4. call it the future of browsing
5. raise $20m

looking at you, comet. and atlas. and literally every other "ai-first" browser.

## what they promise

- "revolutionary browsing experience"
- "ai-powered productivity"
- "the browser reimagined"
- "intelligent web companion"

## what you get

- chromium (again)
- chatgpt/claude in a sidebar
- maybe some summarization features
- 500mb of electron bloat
- another app eating your ram

## the real innovation would be

actually rethinking browsing. not just bolting ai onto the side.

**ideas that would actually be interesting:**
- ai that understands page structure beyond just text
- intelligent tab management that actually works
- privacy-first ai that runs locally
- new ways to navigate the web beyond urls

but no. we get chromium + sidebar. revolutionary.

## why this matters

every new "browser" is just chromium. the web is becoming a monoculture. firefox is hanging on by a thread. safari exists only because apple.

and now ai browsers are making it worse by pretending a wrapper is innovation.

## the sidebar problem

you know what i can do? open chatgpt in a tab. or use raycast. or literally any other tool. 

putting it in a sidebar doesn't make it special. it makes it annoying.

## what i actually want

give me a browser that:
- respects my ram
- doesn't track everything
- has actual innovation in navigation
- integrates ai thoughtfully, not just as a bolt-on
- isn't just chromium in a trench coat

## the truth

these aren't ai browsers. they're chromium distributions with a chatbot. 

stop calling it innovation. it's not. it's lazy.

real innovation would be building something new. but that's hard. wrapping chromium is easy. and vcs love easy.
