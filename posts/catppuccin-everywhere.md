# catppuccin everywhere

if you've been on my site, you've probably noticed the color scheme. it's catppuccin, and i'm obsessed.

## what is catppuccin?

catppuccin is a pastel color palette designed for coding. four flavors: latte (light), frappe, macchiato, and mocha (dark). i use mocha.

## why i love it

- easy on the eyes for long coding sessions
- consistent across all my tools
- vibrant but not overwhelming
- huge community support

## where i use it

- vscode/zed
- terminal (wezterm)
- discord (betterdiscord)
- this website (obviously)
- even my spotify looks catppuccin-ish

## getting started

visit https://catppuccin.com - they have ports for basically everything. seriously, check the list. it's impressive.

## the aesthetic

beyond just colors, it's become part of my digital identity. consistency across tools makes everything feel cohesive. small detail, big impact.
